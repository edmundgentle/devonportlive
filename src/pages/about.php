	<h2>About Devonport Live</h2>
	<div class="para">
		<p>Devonport Live started in 2011 when the Enactus Plymouth team was approached by Plymouth City council about designing a website in Devonport based within their digital inclusion programme. When we heard that the community’s regular newsletter had lost its funding from the New Deal for Communities scheme, we knew we had to help. We understood that the newsletter was the area’s main mode of carrying news, promoting local businesses and advice for people. From this problem, our solution was to create a web-based product for the community of Devonport that would not only produce news and information about the area, but to try and bring the community closer together.</p>
		<p>This was when the Devonport Live website was born. For a year, we have collaborated with the council to help build this website, Devonport Live, as a community hub for people of Devonport, for information centre about what is happening in your area. It will give you a chance to as an individual, to set up your own profile to voice your opinions about news within your local area. And for businesses, for just £20 a year, you can have your own virtual space on the site.</p>
		<p>However, it should be noted that this project couldn’t have happened without the support from various members of the community of Devonport, Plymouth City Council and Enactus Plymouth. Without your support, efforts and kindness, this website would have never been launched. To that I thank you all.</p>
